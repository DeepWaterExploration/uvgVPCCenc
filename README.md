# uvgVPCCenc

uvgVPCCenc is an academic open-source volumetric video encoder for the state of the art Video-based Point-Compression (V-PCC) standard. uvgVPCCenc is being developed in C++ under the BSD-3-Clause license. 
              
The uvgVPCC encoder accepts point cloud frames as input, supports all voxel sizes, and runs on Linux, ~~Windows~~*(coming soon), and macOS. In version 1.0, the focus is on building a functional encoding pipeline using only essential tools and algorithms inspired by the TMC2 reference software. Prioritizing practical encoding, weâ€™ve omitted lossless tools and those adding significant computational complexity. In the future we plan on developing innovative methods to reduce the massive complexity of the V-PCC encoding process. 
  
uvgVPCCenc serves as a research platform for new coding tool development and other encoder research activities as well as provides a high-quality and practical V-PCC encoder for the public to use.

## Compilation and testing

To compile and test the encoder, please use following commands:

```
cmake --preset=CI
cmake --build --preset=CI
